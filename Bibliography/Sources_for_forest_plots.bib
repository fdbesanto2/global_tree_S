	abstract = {Global patterns of biodiversity reflect both regional and local processes, but the relative importance of local ecological limits to species coexistence, as influenced by the physical environment, in contrast to regional processes including species production, dispersal, and extinction, is poorly understood. Failure to distinguish regional influences from local effects has been due, in part, to sampling limitations at small scales, environmental heterogeneity within local or regional samples, and incomplete geographic sampling of species. Here, we use a global dataset comprising 47 forest plots to demonstrate significant region effects on diversity, beyond the influence of local climate, which together explain more than 92\% of the global variation in local forest tree species richness. Significant region effects imply that large-scale processes shaping the regional diversity of forest trees exert influence down to the local scale, where they interact with local processes to determine the number of coexisting species.},

	abstract = {Several old growth (unlogged) and regrowth (logged) stands in the northern jarrah forest of Western Australia were studied in respect of spatial pattern of tree species, segregation between tree species, distribution of trees of each species by diameter class, and tree species composition. The species are Eucalyptus marginata and Eucalyptus calophylla (overstorey) and Banksia grandis, Allocasuarina fraseriana, Persoonia longifolia and Persoonia elliptica (understorey). Most populations of the species are aggregated at small but random at large scale. This pattern probably originates from non-random seed fall. Eucalyptus marginata and B. grandis are segregated, probably for the same reason. Manipulative experiments showed that interspecific competition does not prevent establishment of B. grandis seedlings. On a local scale, heterogeneity in several surface soil properties does not help explain spatial patterns. The diameter-class distributions indicate that regeneration of all species occurs irregularly. This probably results directly from the release of dormant advance growth following temporary reduction in overwood competition induced by disturbance such as wildfire or logging. Banksia grandis is not a rare or scattered component of old growth jarrah forest. A single logging of jarrah trees does not necessarily alter the density or diameter class distribution of B. grandis.},

A total of 108 plant species belonging to 37 families, 77 genera and 8 life forms were identified in all the forest blocks. Trees represented the most diverse life form. Celtis mildbraedii Engl. and Triplochiton scleroxylon K. Shum. were the overall dominant species in the forest reserve. Species richness of all life forms was highest in the UF followed by the DIF and DF. Plant species diversity was quantitatively higher in the UF (H 3.6) compared to the DIF (H 3.3) and DF (H 2.9). Plant species densities also differed significantly (p = 0.000) among the forest types. Mean basal area, canopy cover and height were higher in the UF compared to the DF and DIF. There was a significant positive relationship between tree size and height in all the forest types studied. The distribution of trees in the lower and higher diameter classes was highest in the UF. Diversity of saplings was greatest in the DF (H 2.72). Plant invasion impeded regeneration of native plant species in the DIF. The UF had a higher rate of converting saplings to adult trees. The Tinte Bepo forest reserve looks floristically rich and structurally complex in the face of human activities and plant invasion. Thus, there is the need for proper management intervention to curb these anthropogenic activities and plant invasion so as to protect the integrity of the forest.},

A total of 54 different tree species (24 families) were identified in Ala, 41 species (21 families) in Omo and 55 species (20 families) in Shasha Forest Reserves. The most prevalent species in the ecosystem was Strombosia pustulata, while the family Leguminosae had the highest number of species. Eighty-four percent of the species are regarded as rare or threatened with extinction while 16\% were relatively abundant. The highest species diversity indices were obtained in Shasha Forest Reserve (3.656 and 0.914, Shannon and evenness indices respectively), the lowest in Omo Forest Reserve (3.342 and 0.900 respectively). There was no significant difference in the number of individual ha(-1) on species basis, the relative density of species and also in the distribution of species into families (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Fifty percent of the species could be regarded as habitat generalists as they occurred in the three reserves.

	abstract = {We documented current forest conditions and 39 years of change in community composition and structure in an old-growth, mixed conifer forest in the northern Sierra Nevada. In 1996, we remeasured and mapped a 4-ha stand, originally established by ES. Baker between 1954 and 1961. For trees ≥ 9.5 cm dbh in 1996, total tree density was 721 stems/ha, and total basal area was 75.3 m2/ha. Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco var. menziesii and Abies concolor (Gordon \& Glend.) Lindley codominated the plot. A. concolor was the most abundant tree species, 420 stems/ha, but P. menziesii had the highest basal area, 31.3 m2/ha. A retrospective analysis of trees ≥ 24 cm in dbh showed that in the last 39 years, stand density increased 39\% from 157 to 219 stems/ha, and stand basal area increased 15\% from 57.9 to 66.7 m2/ha. These increases were due largely to the canopy recruitment of A. concolor (60\% of new recruits) and the continued growth and low mortality (0.3\%/ yr) of P. menziesii. Overall stand mortality of trees originally measured by Baker was 0.6\%/yr. Regeneration size classes were dominated (in order of frequency) by A. concolor, P. menziesii, and Calocedrus decurrens (Torrey) Florin. There was little regeneration of the less shade-tolerant pine species, Pinus lambertiana Douglas and Pinus ponderosa Laws.},

	abstract = {A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 500 m2) was established for long-term ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All trees 30 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m2 respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4\%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help to monitor human activity within this forest.},

Succession normally involves deciduous oak species. Cedar seedlings thrive under hardwood trees and shrubs but not under cedar trees, so that some disturbance is apparently necessary for cedar-forest regeneration. To the north, fir may replace the cedar, but over much of the Lebanon range, on northern and western slopes between 1400 and 1800 m, cedar forest may have been the climax vegetation.},

The secondary forest was subjected to moderate and selective exploitation of the most important forest species of the Dry Chaco region, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco Schlecht., over 30 years ago. Density of trees and shrubs ({\textgreater}5cmdbh) was similar in both forests, but total basal area and volume were markedly lower in the secondary forest. Also density of saplings and shrubs ({\textless}5cm diameter) was similar in both forests. A. quebracho-blanco dominated in the primary forest, representing 85\% of the total basal area (8m2) and 92\% of the total stand volume (54.03m3). The secondary forest showed a relative increase of the second most important species, Prosopis flexuosa D.C., and significant differences (P{\textless}0.05) in total basal area (4.72m2) and total stand volume (24.77m3) with respect to the primary forest. Furthermore, a tendency towards an increase of less abundant species of lower economic value as well as invasive shrub species was observed. Total basal area and stand volume of the primary forest are indicators of the possible maximum values expected, and may be used as a reference to develop management plans to regenerate forests.},

	abstract = {Forest biomass estimates are used to help quantify pools and flux of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2–C) from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere associated with land-use and land cover changes. Such estimates based on direct measurements are quite limited for tropical dry forests. The goal of this study was to assess the species composition and biomass density in an intact Mexican forest representative of the tropical dry forest biome. We then compared our measured biomass with biomass estimates computed with a published model in current use. A total of 72 species were found in a 0.5ha stand with a basal area of 31.3m2ha−1. The dominant species, in terms of biomass, were Brosimum alicastrum Sw., Manilkara zapota (L.) Royen, Luehea speciosa Wildl., Pouteria unilocularis (Donn. Sm.) Baehni, Trichilia minutiflora Standl., and Spondias mombin Linn. Tree heights ranged up to 30m and dbh to 82.1cm. Species-specific biomass regression models were developed for the six most common species of large ({\textgreater}10cmdbh) trees and for the nine most common species of small ({\textless}10cmdbh) trees from the destructive harvest of 698 trees. Mass of large trees (n=195) were used to derive the regression model Y=exp\{−2.173+0.868ln(D2TH)+0.0939/2\}, where Y is the total dry weight (kg), D the dbh (cm), and TH the total height (m). Total aboveground tree biomass was estimated to be 225Mgha−1, and was dominated (85\%) by the biomass of the large trees. The actual biomass of each of the 195 large trees was compared to individual tree biomass calculated with a published regression model [Estimating biomass and biomass change of tropical forests. A primer. FAO Forestry Paper 134. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy, 1997] that is based on measurements of 29 trees. We found that the published model underestimated biomass of these trees by 31\% (37.6 versus 54.4Mg). Calculated biomass was less than measured biomass for 29 of 33 species. The current study points to the value of site-specific assessment of aboveground biomass and may contribute to more accurate estimates of dry tropical forest biomass densities currently used to estimate greenhouse gas flux from land management activity.},

A total of 17 samples were taken and four species diversity indices were calculated: Shannon-Wiener's H′, the complement of Simpson's index, d′, Fisher's α and evenness index E. The results reveal the long-tailed rank/abundance diagrams of these forests. However, this feature is greatly reduced in the samples of monsoon forest over limestone. Tropical seasonal rain forest shows the highest tree species diversity of all four vegetation types. Owing to the variation of microenvironment, diversity values within the same vegetation type vary between the samples from different patches. The tree species diversity of single-dominant rain forest is not significantly lower than that of mixed rain forest, because the dominant species of some single-dominant rain forests are principally in the emergent layer. This is composed of sparse and huge trees of one species and, consequently, creates a unique canopy architecture and more heterogeneous microenvironments for the more diversified species composition under the emergent layer. The occurrence of tree species with small population sizes, particularly of species represented by only one individual, is highly correlated with the tree species diversity of the local forest vegetation. They are crucial elements in the richness of local biodiversity.},

However, for some traits, selection during evolutionary history may have also played a role in determining trait values. To address the relative importance of these processes requires large-scale quantification of traits and evolutionary relationships among species. The Amazonian tree flora comprises a high diversity of angiosperm lineages and species with widely differing life-history characteristics, providing an excellent system to investigate the combined influences of evolutionary heritage and selection in determining trait variation. We used trait data related to the major axes of life-history variation among tropical trees (e.g. growth and mortality rates) from 577 inventory plots in closed-canopy forest, mapped onto a phylogenetic hypothesis spanning more than 300 genera including all major angiosperm clades to test for evolutionary constraints on traits. We found significant phylogenetic signal (PS) for all traits, consistent with evolutionarily related genera having more similar characteristics than expected by chance. Although there is also evidence for repeated evolution of pioneer and shade tolerant life-history strategies within independent lineages, the existence of significant PS allows clearer predictions of the links between evolutionary diversity, ecosystem function and the response of tropical forests to global change.},

A series of eight 0.25–0.30 ha plots captured the range of forests present in this region and their structure is described. Overall trends in both uplands and lowlands are for higher sites to be dominated by L. cajanderi with an increasing component of B. platyphylla with decreasing altitude. The tree line on wet sites is commonly formed by mono-dominant B. ermanii forests. Basal area ranged from 7.8–38.1 m2/ha and average tree height from 8.3–24.7 m, both being greater in lowland forests. Size distributions varied considerably among plots, though they were consistently more even for L. cajanderi than B. platyphylla. Upland sites also contained a dense subcanopy of Pinus pumila averaging 38\% of ground area. Soil characteristics differed among plots, with upland soils being of lower pH and containing more carbon. Comparisons are drawn with boreal forests elsewhere and the main current threats assessed.

	abstract = {Stand structure and species diversity were studied in correspondence with micro-topographies in an old-growth forest in southwestern Japan. The study was conducted in a 200×200m2 permanent plot, which were divided into 400 subplots using grids of 10m×10m. Subplots were categorized to four micro-topographies as crest slope (CS), head hollow (HH), upper slope (US) and lower slope (LS), basing on slope of forest floor and plot position, and to two elevational zones as below 450 m and above 450 m. Tree censuses for all individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) ⩾ 5 cm were conducted in 2009 and 2013. The results indicated that CS had subplot means of living stems, dead stems, DBH, basal area (G), and basal area increment (▵G) significantly higher than that in LS. While, means of recruited stems and Shannon diversity index were significantly lower. Comparing between below and above 450 m elevational zones indicated the significantly higher parameters of stand structure and species diversity in above 450 m elevational zone. The differences of edaphic conditions led to difference of density of living stems, species density, DBH, G, and ▵G among micro-topographies. Therefore, crest slope, upper slope, and higher elevational zones should be encouraged for the purposes of carbon accumulation and storage. While, the lower elevational zones should be used for the purposes of species diversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Question:  How does fire affect the aggregation patterns of trees in a species-poor oak woodland? Location:  East-central Minnesota, USA. Methods:  More than 10 000 trees with DBH {\textgreater} 2 cm (comprising more than 11 000 stems) were monitored in a 16-ha grid on an annual basis from 1995- 2001 in a species-poor temperate woodland. Different portions of the grid experienced different frequencies of controlled burns. Aggregation indices were calculated for individual species and individual size classes within species. A community-wide aggregation index was also calculated for different burn units. Spatial data were managed, and many of the aggregation indices calculated using a GIS ArcInfo™ (ESRI). Results:  Fire initially increased clumping, although repeated fires reduced it, a finding that suggests a corollary to the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis, the corollary stating that intermediate levels of disturbance are expected to maximize community-wide patterns of aggregation. Analyses also showed that all species are aggregated at small scales, that the degree of aggregation of a stem type (species or size) declines with distance from individual stems, that the degree of aggregation of large stems is usually less than that of small stems, and that rare species are more aggregated than common species. Findings from this study are consistent with those from similar studies in other temperate and tropical forests, woodlands, and savannas. Conclusion:  The spatial patterns of trees in this woodland are dynamic, continually changing in response to the relative strengths of the often opposing forces of competition, which tends to reduce clumping, and disturbance, which, at low and intermediate frequencies, tends to increase it.},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of trees in relation to topography was investigated using two topographic indices, slope steepness and slope configuration, in a 4-ha plot in a subtropical evergreen forest in the northern part of Okinawa Island, Japan. Most species showed an aggregated distribution and patch size was related to various microtopographical features, including small ridges and valleys. In a cluster analysis based on the dissimilarity of each species’ distribution, the species were divided into three major clusters. A significant correlation between the dissimilarity and the distance between each species on the axis of the two topographic indices indicated that species association was, in part, explained by the topographic indices. I suggest that species distributed on steep and concave slopes regenerate depending on disturbances such as landslides on unstable topography, whereas species distributed on ridges and upper slopes regenerate depending on the canopy gap. A number of species that were less abundant in the 4-ha plot occurred in the riparian area near a stream, where the density of more abundant species was low. The results of this study support the existence of habitat niche divergence related to topography in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest.},

They are characterized by a seasonal climate, with a dry season of 4–7 months. Large parts of these ecosystems are degrading due to grazing, fire or exploitation by people. We studied species richness and productivity patterns of dry woodlands in Ethiopia. For such ecosystems, classic productivity and diversity hypotheses predict that species richness and productivity increase as the wet season length increases, and decrease when soil conditions create water stress. We inventoried and measured trees in 18 2-ha plots distributed in two sites, one higher altitude site with a shorter wet season than the lower altitude site. We found that the stand volume per hectare was lower in the site with a shorter wet season. Across all 18 plots we observed that stand volume decreased with soil water stress (estimated from texture and depth). This was in line with the prediction. The species richness was lower in the short-wet-season woodlands, but was unaffected by variation in soil conditions. This suggests that climate driven constraints (wet season length) set the limits to species richness, and not soil conditions. As far as we know, this study is one of the first studies that evaluated these productivity and diversity hypotheses for dry African woodlands.},

	abstract = {Long-term studies of tree population dynamics play an important role in identifying the conservation needs of tropical forest ecosystems. We examined changes in tree population structure and composition over an 18-year period (1981–1999) in three plots located at the center of the Isecheno study site in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya, a forest with a history of logging and other anthropogenic disturbance. DBH size class distribution took the shape of an ‘inverse J’ curve in both 1981 and 1999 and did not differ significantly between the two study periods. Stem density increased significantly during the study with most of the increase occurring in the smallest stem size class (10–14 cm DBH). Nearly all of the most common species in 1981 remained among the most common in 1999, though the density of pioneer species decreased by 21\% during the study. Our results suggest that forest in the study plots remained relatively undisturbed and in good condition over the study period. Forest in the plots also appeared still to be recovering from the selective logging of large trees that took place at Isecheno in the 1940s. In addition to our longitudinal study, we compared tree population parameters at three additional Isecheno sites spread over a distance of ∼1 km that have experienced different histories of disturbance: (i) a lightly human disturbed site (LHD), (ii) a heavily human disturbed site (HHD), and (iii) a cattle disturbed site (CD). While all three sites were selectively logged in the 1940s, the main signs of disturbance today are footpaths at the LHD site, tree stumps at the HHD site, and wide cattle paths at the CD site. Not surprisingly, of the disturbed sites, the LHD site was in the best condition. Trees at the HHD site exhibited extremely poor recruitment into the small size classes, a condition that can probably be attributed to human exploitation of small trees for poles. The CD site appeared to be at an earlier successional stage than the other disturbed sites with its low mean DBH, high overall stem density, and high pioneer species stem density. Browsing and trampling of vegetation by cattle may be the source of the light gaps that have led to the abundance of pioneer species at this site. We conclude that conservation measures applied to central Isecheno, including the establishment of a forest station nearby and ranger patrols, appear to have succeeded, but that the prognosis for the Kakamega Forest in general is bleak if protection efforts are not increased in other parts of the forest, where anthropogenic disturbance remains high. We also note the considerable variation in tree population structure and composition that can occur within a small area depending on the local history of disturbance.},

Based on the longitudinal profile of the slope, the study slope was divided into the relatively gentle upper slope position (US), the steep lower slope position (LS), the flat valley bottom (VB) and the boundary zone between the upper and lower slopes (BS). Spatial dispersal and the association patterns of species were analyzed in upperstory (≥10 cm d.b.h) and understory ({\textless}10 cm d.b.h) layers. Dominant species in the upperstory layer abruptly changed from Cryptomeria to Fagus at the BS site. In contrast, the understory trees of many species, including shade-intolerant and evergreen species, were independent of the location of conspecific upperstory trees or canopy gaps and extended their distributions on and around the BS site. Significant, diverse canopy and subcanopy species occurred at this site in both upperstory and understory layers. On the BS site, which is the lower margin of Cryptomeria-dominated vegetation, there were many medium-sized C. japonica that were killed by uprooting or breaking of the stems as a result of heavy snow pressure. It is suggested that the snow pressure gradient along a slope has a strong influence on community structure and the maintenance of diverse canopy and subcanopy species in this snowy mixed forest.},

	abstract = {Fire history and stand structure was examined in twelve virgin forest stands situated within forest reserves in northern Sweden. The selected stands represented fire refuges as well as different successional stages after fire. Six of the stands were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), three were dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and three were dominated by hairy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) or aspen (Populus tremula L.). In 3 of the southernmost stands, the average fire interval was 34 to 65 years during the late 1600s to late 1800s, but since 1888 no fires had occurred in any of the stands. The absence of fire disturbance since 1888 is probably caused by the fire suppression in the overall landscape. The standing volume of living trees ranged between 87 and 511 m3 ha−1 while the volume of dead trees, including both snags and logs, ranged between 27 and 201 m3 ha−1. The volume of dead trees constituted ca. 30\% of the total stem volume. In the conifer dominated stands, there was a statistically significant relationship between total stem volume, including both living and dead trees, and site productivity. A comparison between the amount of dead and living trees indicated substantial changes in tree species composition in several stands. It is suggested that data on the amount of dead trees, especially logs, and its distribution over decay classes could be used to examine the continuity of certain tree species. All stands had a multi-sized tree diameter distribution, which in most cases was similar to a reversed J-shaped distribution. In general spruce was numerous in the seedling cohort and in small diameter classes, indicating that its proportion in the stands was stable, or was increasing at the expense of pioneer tree species such as pine, aspen and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The most numerous species in the seedling cohort, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), was almost totally missing in the tree layer, indicating a high browsing pressure preventing rowan seedlings from growing into trees. The general increase of spruce and the sparse regeneration of pioneer species, in the stands previously affected by fire, are discussed in relation to natural disturbance regimes, biological diversity and nature conservation policies. It is proposed that reintroduction of fire disturbance is a necessity for future management plans of forest reserves. Other management practices to increase species diversity within forest reserves are also discussed.},

The present work seeks to identify the physiognomic and structural differences between fragments of humid- and dry-forests in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The humid-forest fragment was located in the municipality of São Vicente Férrer (7°37′ S × 35°28′ W) and the dry-forest fragment in the municipality of Aliança (7°38′ S × 35°14′ W). Fifty 10 × 20 m plots were delimited in each area and all individual living plants with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥5 cm were included. It was observed that the total density (1,390 ind ha−1) and total basal area (29.9 m2 ha−1) were greater in the humid-forest than the dry-forest (649 ind ha−1 and 18.7 m2 ha−1, respectively). Individual plants in the humid-forest tended to be taller, while those in the dry-forest had generally larger diameters. There were also differences in the most structurally important families as, for example, Clusiaceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, and Sapotaceae in the humid-forest and Sterculiaceae, Fabaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Moraceae in the dry-forest. Physiognomic differences were also observed in the different forest layers, as the group of species composing the canopy of the dry-forest are dominated by deciduous species, while many of the species in the understory are evergreen. In the humid-forest, both the understory and canopy are predominantly composed of evergreen species. The examination of the phytosociological parameters of average height and species richness allowed us to identify physiognomic differences between humid and dry forests in Pernambuco State. The present study demonstrated that dry forests are not simply floristic/structural subsets of humid forests, and that there is a great need to establish conservation areas to protect these important but spatially restricted forests within the Atlantic coastal domain.},

	abstract = {We described the tree species diversity and floristic composition of a tropical seasonal rainforest located in Xishuangbanna, south-west China, based on a census of all trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) = 10 cm in three 1-ha plots. A total of 1283 stems of 53 families, 125 genera and 207 species were recorded in these plots. Families with greatest importance value were Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, Sapindaceae, Lauraceae and Lecythidaceae. Lauraceae was the most species-rich family. Forest structure was marked by few tall emergent trees, such as Pometia tomentosa (Sapindaceae). The average number of large trees (dbh ≥70 cm) was 15 stems ha-1. Beta diversity indices indicated that tree species composition differed greatly among the three plots. Our results revealed that species diversity of tropical seasonal rainforests in Xishuangbanna was lower than that of tropical lowland rainforest in South-East Asia. This may be due to lower annual precipitation, higher elevation and more distinct seasonality in Xishuangbanna. Additionally, tree species composition in our study area differs from that of the dipterocarp forests in South-East Asia. This study will help us to understand the patterns of tree species composition and diversity in the northern edge of tropical Asia.},

	abstract = {In a subtropical montane forest of north-western Argentina (27°S, 1000 m elevation), we analysed the effect of crown illumination, trunk diameter, foliar phenology and tree species identity as determinants of liana–host tree associations, as well as the spatial pattern of liana abundance in a 6-ha permanent plot. We recorded 2346 liana individuals [greater-than-or-equal] 2 cm and 2320 trees [greater-than-or-equal] 10 cm dbh. Sixty-five per cent of the trees hosted at least one liana stem. Large and well-lit trees were more likely to support lianas and supported more liana abundance than small and shaded trees. Yet, when trees were standardized by their size (liana basal area/tree basal area ratio), lianas were more abundant in smaller and less-exposed trees. Foliar phenology and tree species identity showed no association with the frequency of liana colonization and their abundance. Overall, tree features played a minor or even neutral role in structuring the liana community within this forest. Instead, lianas showed a positive autocorrelation at spatial scales up to 40 m. This suggests that lianas might be mostly structured by light-and dispersal-related factors such as those involving canopy access or canopy disturbances, with a negligible effect of host species identity and foliar phenology.},

	abstract = {* Ecological disturbances are often hypothesized to alter community assembly processes that influence variation in community composition (β-diversity). Disturbance can cause convergence in community composition (low β-diversity) by increasing niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Alternatively, disturbance can cause divergence in community composition (high β-diversity) by increasing habitat filtering across environmental gradients. However, because disturbance may also influence β-diversity through random sampling effects owing to changes in the number of individuals in local communities (community size) or abundances in the regional species pool, observed patterns of β-diversity alone cannot be used to unambiguously discern the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms.


* We compared β-diversity of woody plants and inferred assembly mechanisms among unburned forests and forests managed with prescribed fires in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. Using a null-model approach, we compared how environmental gradients influenced β-diversity after controlling for differences in local community size and regional species abundances between unburned and burned landscapes.


* Observed β-diversity was higher in burned landscapes. However, this pattern disappeared or reversed after controlling for smaller community size in burned landscapes.


* β-diversity was higher than expected by chance in both landscapes, indicating an important role for processes that create clumped species distributions. Moreover, fire appeared to decrease clumping of species at broader spatial scales, suggesting homogenization of community composition through niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Environmental variables, however, explained similar amounts of variation in β-diversity in both landscapes, suggesting that disturbance did not alter the relative importance of habitat filtering.


* Our results indicate that contingent responses of communities to fire reflect a combination of fire-induced changes in local community size and scale-dependent effects of fire on species clumping across landscapes.


* Synthesis. Although niche-based mechanisms of community assembly are often invoked to explain changes in community composition following disturbance, our results suggest that these changes also arise through random sampling effects owing to the influence of disturbance on community size. Comparative studies of these processes across disturbed ecosystems will provide important insights into the ecological conditions that determine when disturbance alters the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in natural and human-modified landscapes.},

probabilities were also calculated from gapfillers in different life stages to examine canopy replacement patterns. The structure
and composition of tree regeneration were similar between gaps and the forest as a whole, and there was no relationship between
overall regeneration density and gap size, indicating most individuals established prior to gap formation. Likewise, there
was no strong evidence of gap-size partitioning for shade tolerant F.sylvatica and A.alba, although less tolerant Acerpseudoplatanus only recruited to taller life stages in larger gaps. Transition probabilities calculated from the seedling and sapling data
suggest that most gaps will be captured by F.sylvatica, while probabilities based on pole-sized gapmakers indicate both A.alba and F.sylvatica will be maintained in the canopy. We suggest that gaps primarily play a role in reorganizing advance regeneration, and that
coexistence of shade tolerant F.sylvatica and A.alba is more likely related to their differential ability to tolerate shaded understory conditions, particularly during larger
life stages, rather than gap-size partitioning.

The study site was located in the Sannosuke beech forest (42°46′48″N, 140°23′43″E), a representative outlying beech stand beyond its continuous range. A rectangular 0.75 ha plot was established on a southwest-facing slope and divided into 300 square sub-plots of 25 m2. Within each sub-plot, stems over 5 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) were identified and measured. Furthermore, the location of stems over 10 cm in DBH (canopy stem) was recorded within each sub-plot, and their increment core samples were extracted. Wood from fallen logs was sampled to estimate the species composition of the coarse woody debris. Micro-relief of the plot was investigated by leveling with compasses for a 2.5 m × 2.5 m grid system. In the plot, the population of F. crenata was divided into three sub-populations by their frequency distribution of age. The oldest sub-population, over 121 years old, had been established in small-localized gap in the plot. The sub-population between 81 and 120 years old and the sub-population less than 80 years old were regenerated after a landslide and windthrow in a 1954 typhoon, respectively. Furthermore, dominant species in the plot shifted from Quercusmongolica var. grosseserrata to F. crenata. Consequently, regeneration of F. crenata, i.e., expansion of forest stands, at the northernmost boundary of its range was primarily dependent on episodic natural disturbance, which may be responsible for the reduction of their migration rate in Hokkaido, northern Japan.},

	abstract = {The tropical flora remains chronically understudied and the lack of floristic understanding hampers ecological research and its application for large-scale conservation planning. Given scarce resources and the scale of the challenge there is a need to maximize the efficiency of both sampling strategies and sampling units, yet there is little information on the relative efficiency of different approaches to floristic assessment in tropical forests. This paper is the first attempt to address this gap. We repeatedly sampled forests in two regions of Amazonia using the two most widely used plot-based protocols of floristic sampling, and compared their performance in terms of the quantity of floristic knowledge and ecological insight gained scaled to the field effort required. Specifically, the methods are assessed first in terms of the number of person-days required to complete each sample (‘effort’), secondly by the total gain in the quantity of floristic information that each unit of effort provides (‘crude inventory efficiency’), and thirdly in terms of the floristic information gained as a proportion of the target species pool (‘proportional inventory efficiency’). Finally, we compare the methods in terms of their efficiency in identifying different ecological patterns within the data (‘ecological efficiency’) while controlling for effort. There are large and consistent differences in the performance of the two methods. The disparity is maintained even after accounting for regional and site-level variation in forest species richness, tree density and the number of field assistants. We interpret our results in the context of selecting the appropriate method for particular research purposes.},

We evaluated the anthropogenic effects of the daily activities of neighboring residents on natural forests in 12 plots extending from the village boundary into a natural forest in Thailand. The basal area per unit land area did not present a significant trend; however, the species diversity of woody plants decreased linearly towards the village boundary, which caused a loss of individual density because of severe declines in small saplings compared with adult trees and large saplings in proximity to the village. An analysis of tree-size categories indicates a lack of small samplings near the village boundary. The current forest appears to be well protected based on the adult tree canopy, but regeneration of the present-day forests is unlikely because of the loss of seedlings.},

Question:

We were interested if and how variation in frequency and/or size of disturbances affect the dynamics of a montane old-growth forest in Central Europe.


Location:

The forest, co-dominated by Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Abies alba, is located in Lower Austria and represents one of the few sizable virgin forests in Central Europe.


Methods:

We extracted cores from 100 trees using systematic grid sampling (grid cell size 10 m × 10 m) on each of four 1-ha plots distributed across the old-growth remnant of 300 ha. We inferred disturbance events from rapid early growth and release events. For defining release criteria, we applied the boundary line method. We investigated the spatial structure of current age and gap distributions and past disturbance events in grid cells, using a pair density statistic.


Results:

The disturbance histories indicate decades with peaks and also extended periods without disturbance. Some peaks occurred synchronously at three of the four plots (1910s, 1930s, 1960s and 1980s). Peaks and gaps in the disturbance chronologies widely agreed with peaks and gaps in the age distributions. Most disturbance events during single decades showed a random spatial distribution.


Conclusions:

There is considerable variation in disturbance frequency and/or severity over time. Most disturbance events will rather thin the stand than clear larger areas at once. Following scattered disturbance two pathways occur: (1) gap expansion leading to creation of larger gaps, and (2) gap closure by lateral encroachment or by subcanopy trees growing into the canopy.},

We propose four strategies that may help tree species persist under these conditions: repellence, resistance, tolerance and avoidance. We sought and found evidence for each strategy. Large, shade-tolerant Cynometra alexandri dominated basal area (often {\textgreater}50\%) and showed severe scarring. Nearly 80 percent of stems were small pioneer species. Scarring frequency and intensity increased with stem size. Stem-size distributions declined steeply, implying a high mortality to growth rate ratio. Tree species with spiny stems or with known toxic bark defenses were unscarred. Epiphytic figs escaped damage while at small sizes. Mid-successional tree species were scarce and appeared sensitive to elephants. Savanna species were seldom scarred. Taking stem size-effects into account by using a per-stem logistic modeling approach, scarring became more probable with slower growth and with increasing species abundance, and also varied with location. Pioneer and shade-bearer guilds showed a deficit of intermediate-sized stems. Evidence that selective elephant damage is responsible for monodominant C. alexandri forests remains equivocal; however, elephants do influence tree diversity, forest structure, and the wider landscape.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are global centres of biodiversity and carbon storage. Many tropical countries aspire to protect forest to fulfil biodiversity and climate mitigation policy targets, but the conservation strategies needed to achieve these two functions depend critically on the tropical forest tree diversity-carbon storage relationship. Assessing this relationship is challenging due to the scarcity of inventories where carbon stocks in aboveground biomass and species identifications have been simultaneously and robustly quantified. Here, we compile a unique pan-tropical dataset of 360 plots located in structurally intact old-growth closed-canopy forest, surveyed using standardised methods, allowing a multi-scale evaluation of diversity-carbon relationships in tropical forests. Diversity-carbon relationships among all plots at 1 ha scale across the tropics are absent, and within continents are either weak (Asia) or absent (Amazonia, Africa). A weak positive relationship is detectable within 1 ha plots, indicating that diversity effects in tropical forests may be scale dependent. The absence of clear diversity-carbon relationships at scales relevant to conservation planning means that carbon-centred conservation strategies alone would inevitably miss many high diversity ecosystems. As tropical forests can have any combination of tree diversity and carbon stocks both will require explicit consideration when optimising policies to manage tropical carbon and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Natural karst forests can support very high level of biodiversity, but difference of species diversity between the natural karst forests and non-karst forests is still less concerned. To analyze the difference of species diversity of the natural karst forests and non-karst forests in subtropics, we made a census of all woody species with diameter at breast height (dbh)≥1 cm in a 1-ha plot in Mulun subtropical karst forests and a 1-ha plot in Maoershan subtropical non-karst forests, Guangxi of south-western China. Species richness in Mulun plot (120 species) was higher than that in Maoershan plot (116 species). Mulun plot contained more families and genera, more stems and a larger proportion of rare species (species of individuals less than or equal to 1 ha-1). At smaller scale ({\textless}4000 m2), species accumulation rate in Mulun plot was lower than that in Maoershan plot, and it was reversed at larger scale ({\textgreater}5000 m2). Total basal area in Mulun plot (18.47 m2) was smaller than that in Maoershan plot (30.74 m2). Size structure distribution of all woody species in the two plots showed insignificant difference. The ten most dominant species, families and genera were quite different in the two plots. In Mulun plot, the most important species and family were Sinosideroxylon wightianum and Sapindaceae, while in Maoershan plot, Castanopsis carlesii and Fagaceae were the most important species and family. All these results suggest that middle subtropical natural karst forest in Mulun supports diverse species with high spatial variability, and their species composition are quite different with non-karst forests. This study implies that special attention is needed on selecting suitable species in karst forest restoration and vegetation management strategies.},

	volume = {30},
	abstract = {Annually reproducing wild yam species (Dioscorea praehensilis and D. semperflorens) are considered to be the most important food for hunter-gatherer subsistence in terms of energy sources in the central African rainforests. Despite their importance in the rainforest hunter-gatherer's diet, annual yams are not widely distributed over the forest but locally concentrated in particular areas. In this study, I carried out vegetation censuses in two areas, one with abundant annual yam patches and one with few in southeastern Cameroon. The results indicate that the area with abundant annual yam patches is closely associated with the semi-deciduous forest, while the area with few patches was associated with the evergreen forest. Thus the difference in vegetation seems to affect the distribution and the availability of annual yam patches. However, recent studies have found evidence of historical human interventions that may have influenced the formation of semi-deciduous forest over the Congo Basin. Therefore, the degree of human influence on the distribution of the semi-deciduous forest itself, as well as that of annual yam patches, should be carefully examined to explain the abundance of annual yams.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Species composition, density, importance value index, diversity, dominance and tree population structure were studied in disturbed and undisturbed stands of tropical semi-evergreen forest in Lunglei District of Mizoram, North-East India. Total number of species in the undisturbed stand was 67 while in the disturbed stand 63 species were recorded. Number of tree and shrub species in the undisturbed stand were higher (32 and 18) than the disturbed stand (17 and 16). However, the number of herbaceous species remained higher in the disturbed stand (30) compared to the undisturbed stand (17). Castanopsis tribuloides (Smith) was common in both stands, and showed dominance in the undisturbed stand with a density of 90 individuals' ha-1. However Schima wallichii (DC.) Korth Choicy was dominant in the disturbed stand with a density of 125 individuals' ha-1. In both stands higher dbh classes showed lower density than that of the lower and intermediate girth classes. In general, the undisturbed forest stand showed more density of trees in each dbh classes and the intermediate girth class in particular. The study reveals that the anthropogenic disturbance causes disruption of forest structure and changes community composition which ultimately leads to disruption of tree population structure.},
