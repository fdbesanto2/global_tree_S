# Global patterns and drivers of tree diversity integrated across a continuum of spatial grains

## Authors

 *Petr Keil & Jonathan M. Chase*

## Description

This repository contains all data and code for the global analysis of drivers of tree species richness at multiple spatial resolutions, which is due to appear in *Nature Ecology and Evolution*.

The main dataset that was used to fit the models reported in the paper is the [Data/Main_dataset_full_detail.csv](https://github.com/petrkeil/global_tree_S/blob/master/Data/Main_dataset_full_detail.csv).
